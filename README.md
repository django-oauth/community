# Django OAuth Organization

This organization exists to maintain various 3rd Party OAuth tools for Django, principally the Django OAuth Toolkit. The organization shall be loosely modelled on [Jazzband](https://jazzband.co/) and [Django Commons](https://django-commons.org/), but eschewing the central shared organization concept in favor of a more a distrbuted approach. 


## Participating

Anyone can contribute! Just fork a repo and open a PR. 

## Becoming a maintainer. 

If you're interested in becoming a maintain, open an issue and ask. You will need to have been a contributor and demonstrated adherence to the [Values](#values) and [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) below.
